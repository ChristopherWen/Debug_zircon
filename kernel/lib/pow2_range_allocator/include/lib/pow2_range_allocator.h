/**
 * The pow2_range_allocator is a small utility library which partitions a set of
 * ranges of integers into sub-ranges which are power of 2 in length and power
 * of 2 aligned and then manages allocating and freeing the subranges for
 * clients.  It is responsible for breaking larger sub-regions into smaller ones
 * as needed for allocation, and for merging sub-regions into larger sub-regions
 * as needed during free operations.
 *
 * Its primary use is as a utility library for plaforms who need to manage
 * allocating blocks MSI IRQ IDs on behalf of the PCI bus driver, but could (in
 * theory) be used for other things).
