# NOTE(raggi): kilo.c inclusion is disabled for now, as it is the only
# non-BUILDDIR-relative entry in bootfs.manifest. Having the relative entry
# means that rebuilding bootdata from the manifest must be run from inside the
# zircon source tree. We do not expose a source directory, and we don't want to
# use absolute paths in the build here. We could install the file to the build
# dir instead.
